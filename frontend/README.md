## Installation
`npm install`

## Development
To start the web server type `npm run serve` and navigate to localhost:3001

## Deployment
Run `npm run build` and take /frontend/index.html and /frontend/build/bundle.js.  Also take any fonts/images you added as those don't get bundled.  Currently don't have a production build setup.
