//We add stylesheets here so they get bundled into bundle.js.  There's probably better ways but this is easiest to me.
//All you have to do is import them below like "import css# from '../../stylesheets/newCss.css'" make sure to increase the "css#" number.

import css1 from '../../stylesheets/home.css';
import css2 from '../../stylesheets/nav.css';

class CSSImport {

}

export default CSSImport;
